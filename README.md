# 🛠️ Technologies & Methodology

## 🔍 Project Scope & Objectives

* Developed a data-driven analysis system for evaluating student performance based on attendance, theory, and practical marks.
* Designed customized insights and recommendations to help educators identify patterns and improve academic outcomes.
* Implemented a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard to visualize and interpret key trends.

## 📥 Data Collection & Preprocessing

* Gathered raw student performance data from institutional records.
* Cleaned and structured the dataset using Pandas & NumPy.
* Handled missing values, normalized data, and ensured consistency for accurate analysis.

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization

* Explored data distribution using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
* Applied correlation analysis to identify relationships between attendance, theory, and practical scores.
* Built custom graphs and heatmaps for deeper insight into student performance trends.

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling & Insights Generation

* Utilized Scikit-Learn to explore regression models predicting student success.
* Analyzed how attendance impacts academic performance through statistical measures.
* Generated automated recommendations for students and educators based on findings.

## 🌍 Deployment & Accessibility

* Developed an interactive Streamlit web app for educators to input student data and receive real-time insights.
* Hosted the project on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
