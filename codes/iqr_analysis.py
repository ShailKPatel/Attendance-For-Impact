'''ðŸ“Š Interpretation of IQR Levels
IQR Range	Attendance Spread	What It Reveals	Recommended Action
â‰¤ 10	Very Low Variability	Most students have similar attendanceâ€”either high or low.	If high: Ensure engagement. If low: Investigate attendance barriers.
10 - 20	Moderate Variability	Attendance is somewhat consistent, with slight differences.	Monitor for small attendance gaps and intervene if needed.
20 - 30	Noticeable Variability	Some students attend regularly, others are inconsistent.	Identify and support students with irregular attendance.
â‰¥ 30	Very High Variability	Extreme differencesâ€”some students attend almost daily, others barely show up.	Conduct outreach to understand and address low-attendanceÂ reasons.'''
